                    <h1>The bball</h1>
                    <p>Basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, by Canadian physical
                         education instructor James Naismith as a less injury-prone sport than football. Naismith was a
                          31-year-old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during
                                    the winters.[1] The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th
                         century progressed, first in America and then in other parts of the world. After basketball
                                   became established in American colleges, the professional game followed. The American National
                                  Basketball Association (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a multibillion-dollar enterprise
                         by the end of the century, and basketball became an integral part of American culture.

                        A game similar to basketball is mentioned in a 1591 book published in Frankfurt am Main that reports on the lifestyles
                         and customs of coastal North American residents, Wahrhafftige Abconterfaytung der Wilden.[2] Among other things, a game 
                          of skill is described in which balls must be thrown against a target woven from twigs, mounted high on a pole in the 
                          middle of a large playing field. There's a small reward for the player if the target is being hit.[3]

                     The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, 
                     to condition young athletes during cold months. Naismith was a physical education instructor at YMCA International
                      Training School (now known as Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Upon the request of his boss, Naismith
                       was tasked to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape in cold weather.[1] It consisted of peach
                        baskets and a soccer style ball. He published 13 rules for the new game. He divided his class of eighteen into two teams
                        of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game. The objective of the game was to throw the
                         basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony. Every time a point was scored, the
                          game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball. After a while, the bottoms of the
                           fruit baskets were removed.

                     The first public basketball game was played in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1892.

                        Naismith's original rules

An illustration of a basketball game that accompanied Naismith's article from The Triangle in 1892 listing his 13 rules.
There were only thirteen rules of "basket ball":
</p>

   <p>
1.The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands.

  </p>
  <p>
2.A player cannot run with the ball, the player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made
 for a man who catches the ball when running at good speed.

 </p>
 <p></p>
The ball must be held in or between the hands, the arms or body must not be used for holding it.
No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed. The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute.
A foul is striking the ball with the fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such as described in rule 5.
If either side makes three consecutive fouls it shall count a goal for opponents.
A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from grounds into the basket and stays there. If the ball rests on the edge and the opponent moves the basket it shall count as a goal.
When the ball goes out of bounds it shall be thrown into the field and played by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The "thrower-in" is allowed five seconds. If he holds it longer it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on them.
The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls, and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made.
The referee shall be the judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in-bounds, and to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.
The time shall be fifteen-minute halves, with five-minute rests between.
The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In the case of a draw, the game may, by agreement of the captains,
 be continued until another goal is made.
 "Long ago, in the winter of 1892... a simple game was born inside a cold gymnasium in Springfield. No one knew then... that this game would
  one day shake the entire world. This... is the story of basketball."
